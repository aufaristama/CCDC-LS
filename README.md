# CCDC-LS

This project utilizes advanced remote sensing techniques to provide a reliable and scalable method for detecting landslides. The integration of CCDC within GEE offers a powerful tool for disaster management and historical analysis of landslide events. The code proposal demonstrates how to implement this approach using GEE's capabilities, aiming to contribute to global efforts in monitoring and mitigating landslide impacts.
